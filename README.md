### Hi there 👨‍💻
I am a professional specialized in the Cloud area, with a main focus on the Salesforce cloud platform and its tools for over 3 years. I work as a Salesforce Consultant for [IBM Brazil](https://www.ibm.com/br-pt), handling large projects.

In addition to teaching classes focused on Technology for the [Instituto da Oportunidade da Social](https://ios.org.br/), an NGO in São Paulo, capital.

### Expertise 💼
My main focus is Salesforce, where I've been specializing and taking certifications. In addition to expanding my studies in AWS, GCP, Azure and IBM Cloud.

I really like working with Cloud because I believe it is a universe apart, and developing and architecting new features captivates me.
